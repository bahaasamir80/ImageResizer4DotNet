******************************************************************
This is a .NET library written in C# to resize images at three
different qualities of low, medium, and high. The advantage of
this library is that the high quality mode produces images
identical to the output of professional software like Paint.NET.

The implementation is described in details on my blog:

Important Note:

The use of current version may cause memory leakes in services
and ASP.NET applications.
